# Goal
The goal of this project is to create a library of design patterns to use everyday in real projects.
The pattern should require minimal code to be used.
# Standard for new commits
Be sure that
1. code is validated against the specification defined in the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"<br/>
2. all the tests are always green and cover all the features<br/>
3. all code is pep-8, validated using flake-8 (black) <br/>
4. TODO code annotations and typing validated <br/>
5. Code is commented when needed<br/>
